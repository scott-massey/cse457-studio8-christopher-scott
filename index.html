      <h2>Dogs breeds by borough</h2>
      <p>
        New York City is a diverse city not only for its people, but also it's 
        dog breeds. Shown here are what dogs breeds people in different boroughs of NYC
        people own. The larger the circle, the more dogs of that breed are owned
        in that borough.

      <h2>Dogs by age</h2>
      <p>
        Considering moving here with your dog and looking considering for compatible 
        friends for you dog? Or maybe just curious about dog age statistics (I'm not
        judging)? This graphic shows the distribution of dogs in each borough by age. We
        found that people generally own younger dogs in Manhattan and Brooklyn,
        and older dogs in the other boroughs.

      <h2>Conclusions</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, the distributions between boroughs did not differ much between
        each other. It seems like smaller breeds, such as the Chihuahua are more
        popular. The most popular names are Bella, Max, Rocky, and Charlie. Age
        distributions also did not vary much. With this, we see that the boroughs, though
        different geographic regions, have similarities in terms of their dogs. Any of the 
        boroughs would be a great place to visit and enjoy the pet-life. Thanks for reading!
